<font color='crimson' size='+1'><b>NOTE: This project is obsolete and replaced by the</b><i>afl-tmin</i> tool bundled with <a href='http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/'>american fuzzy lop</a>. **</font>**

A quick and simple tool to minimize the size and syntax of complex test cases in automated security testing.

The tool is somewhat related to [delta](http://delta.tigris.org/), a more featured general-purpose optimizer - but is meant specifically for dealing with unknown or complex data formats (without the need to tokenize and re-serialize testcases), for hands-off detection of security fault conditions, and for easy integration with UI testing harnesses.

It is also capable of reducing the complexity of alphabets used on datasets that cannot be further trimmed down in size.
